  "Iterate through a tree, represented as a pre-ordered list.

The predicate defines the ancestry relationship, *transitively*. E.g. < or ≤ or
⊆ or string-prefix-p. The list must be ordered by this predicate.

The domain of the predicate is a partial order; that’s why e.g. ⊂ and
string-prefix-p are valid predicates. That’s a fancy way of saying: it’s ok for
some elements to not be comparable at all, e.g. {x} ⊄ {y} /and/ {y} ⊄ {x}.

The callback is called on every direct parent-child pair in the tree. So for
1,2,3, you get cb(1,2) and cb(2,3) but not cb(1,3). Even though the predicate
should return T for P(1,3).

The base is a parent value which is used as the original root. The return value
is the list starting at the first element which is not a child of this parent.

E.g. if root is 0, ancestry is ≤, and list is '(0 1 1 0 1 -2 1 2), the return
value would be '(-2 1 2).

Normally, you'd call this with a parent element of all elements, and you expect
to get the empty list as a return value.

Example:

  (do-tree #'uiop:string-prefix-p
           \"\"
           (lambda (x y) (format T \"~A -> ~A~%\" x y))
           (uiop:split-string \"A AA AAA AAB AB AC B BA BB\"))

 -> A
A -> AA
AA -> AAA
AA -> AAB
A -> AB
A -> AC
 -> B
B -> BA
B -> BB

(define-cmd git-graft (root onto)
  "Print a chain of commands to move an entire subtree of git branches.

Usage:

  git-graft ROOT ONTO

Move all branches that are a child of one commit, onto another commit, while
maintaining the git commit tree structure.

ROOT: the first commit under (and including) which all local branches will be
selected.

ONTO: the commit onto which the subtree will be moved.

Example: say after a git fetch, you end up with:

  A -> B -> master -> C -> D -> origin/master
              \\
                --> E -> branch1 -> F -> branch2
                           \\
                             -----> G -> branch3

Execute this:

  git-graft E origin/master

And you will get a bunch of git commands on stdout. Execute them all, and you
should end up with:

  ... -> D -> origin/master -> E -> branch1 -> F -> branch2
                                      \\
                                        -----> G -> branch3

Every local branch under (and including) branch1 will be moved, so be careful
choosing something like (e.g.) master. It will work if all branches under master
are indeed feature branches that you 'own', but if you locally checked out
someone else's branch, it will also be rebased.

Git-graft also prints \"undo\" commands, commented out. These are not expected
to be necessary for normal operation, but if something goes wrong midway through
a big graft, you can use those commands to go back to the pre-graft state.

The argument to git-graft, the root, is *inclusive*. This is at odds with git
conventions, where you normally specify a commit's 'parent', under which all
relevant commits are found. The reason is that sometimes, e.g. the example
above, choosing the parent can lead to too many branches being included: you'd
get origin/master, and all potential other local branches already ported onto
it.
